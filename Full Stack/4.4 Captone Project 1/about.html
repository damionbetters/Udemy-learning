    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      It was November of 1987 when me, my big brother, and my grandparents moved
      from Salt Lake City, Utah to the OP. The OP is referring to Oak Park, it's
      a small suburb of Detroit. You see, I was born on the 27th and as soon as
      we left the hospital, we left for Michigan. Michgian was a fantastic place
      to grow up. Beautiful scenery, great people, and great lakes. THE great
      lakes to be specific, and boy does the name fit. We could get to four out
      of the five great lakes where we were. And a lot of people love to go out
      fishing, hiking, and camping around, well, the whole state actually. But,
      the lakes are a popular destination for those who enjoy hobbies like that.

      Me personally, I do not care for those activities. I mean, I did them, but
      only because my family wanted to. I remember one time we were out fishing;
      and I caught like five or six fish, but they turned out to be trout. I did
      end up catching a bass though. But again, I did not care for those kinds
      of things. I thoroughly enjoyed being on my computer and playing video
      games. I enjoyed woodworking as well, but didnt get to do that as much.
      Oh, I also hated playing sports, which I did a lot of. Football, hockey,
      basketball, baseball, tennis, golf; I mean a lot of sports. And I was
      fairly good in most of them. Execpt for tennis, I suck at tennis ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£. It
      gets really bad when I'm out there. But none of that stuff really suited
      me, I always fell back to my pc. Playing video games and listening to

      >. I do enjoy reading a good book. There aren't too many "good" books out
      there to me. I did enjoy <cite>Life 3.0</cite> by Max Tegmart, but
      everything else I read are self help books.
