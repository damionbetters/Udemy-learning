    <h1>The Best Movies According to Damion</h1>
    <h2>My Top Three Movies</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Teenage Mutant Ninga Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze</h3>
    <p>
      This is my absolute favorte movie ever made. Is it an excellent piece of
      cinematic history that carries you through an elaborate and quite unique
      story that will leave the viewer totally engaged? No. Is it still
      <b>AWESOME</b>? YES!
    </p>
    <h3>Ex Machina</h3>
    <p>
      I believe this is a must watch for anyone pursuing a career in machine
      learning or artificial intelligence. It is gripping, great visually, and
      just an overall good time.

    <h3>Vampire in Brooklyn</h3>
    <p>
      This is a guilty pleasure of mine. It combines one of my favorite sci-fi
      creatures and the culture of my people. It isn't a <em>great</em> movie,
      and the writting could use a lot of work, but it is enjoyable nonetheless.
      Eddie Murphy and Angela Bassett's acting carry this movie higher than it
      should be listed in my rankings.
